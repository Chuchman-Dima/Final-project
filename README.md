# 📈 AI Final Project: Linear Regression Web App

This project is a full-cycle machine learning application built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**. It covers everything from synthetic data generation to interactive model deployment.

---

## 📋 Project Overview
The core objective is to build a simple linear regression model that predicts target values based on input features. The project is split into two main phases:
1.**Model Development:** Training and evaluating the regression model.
2.**Web Deployment:** Serving the model via an interactive Streamlit application.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
***Machine Learning:** [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) (Linear Regression)
***Web Framework:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
***Visualization:** Matplotlib
***Serialization:** Joblib

## ✨ Key Features
### 1. Model Training & Evaluation
***Synthetic Data:** Generation of a custom dataset for training and testing[cite: 4].
***Model Serialization:** Saving the trained model as a `.joblib` file for efficient loading.
***Performance Metrics:** Calculation of **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to evaluate accuracy.

### 2. Interactive Web Application
***Feature Input:** A slider to select feature values for real-time prediction.
***Visual Comparison:** A scatter plot displaying the dataset, the actual target, and the predicted value.
***Difference Annotation:** Automatic calculation and visualization of the error (difference) on the chart.
